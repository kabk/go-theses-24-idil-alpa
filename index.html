        According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs,<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> the need
        for
        shelter is one of the basic necessities for a human to grow and
        evolve. Taking the global housing shortage into account, today this
        seems even more relevant than ever before. When put in a personal
        context, almost anyone reading this text would be able to relate to it
        on many levels. Even the privileged struggle with housing: finding a
        place, rental contracts, house owners, repairments, and the list goes
        on. Residential issues create a stress factor in people’s lives,
        especially in urban settings like big cities. When we use the word
        “housing”, what usually comes to mind is a 2+1 flat or a nice house
        with some greenery. However, as finding a place to settle became
        harder, alternative ways of living emerged. Currently, tiny houses and
        van life are the most popular ones since they provide mobility for
        relatively cheaper prices. Squat houses, houseboats, treehouses,
        tents, yurts, and cooperative houses can be considered as other ways
        of residing which don’t come to mind immediately when the word
        “housing” is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming from Istanbul, a megalopolis with a rapidly growing housing
        market fuelled by neoliberal policies, it is relatively easy to
        observe the impact that housing issues have on citizens. As a person
        who lives in both countries, Turkey and Holland, when one compares the
        housing crisis in the Hague and Istanbul, the biggest difference is
        that in Istanbul, citizens tend to take more agency over the problem
        and create their own solutions. One reason for this might be the
        vastness of the city of Istanbul which has become a megalopolis in
        which regulations are difficult to sustain when it comes to certain
        informal settlements. These informal settlements are named gecekondu
        and they can be considered as the best example of a DIY philosophy, a
        disobedience towards legal restrictions and means to create a home.
        Gecekondu, in a literal sense, means landed overnight. This term
        occurred when people from the eastern part of Türkiye started
        migrating to bigger cities. As they wanted to settle, they built their
        own illegal houses on empty lands they found, whether these plots of
        land were unowned remains controversial. Since then, gecekondu
        settlements have become a prominent part of the urban landscape of
        Istanbul, and many layers of meanings shaped throughout time around
        this word. They come with a complex cultural, social, and economic
        structure, being used to indicate certain stereotypes and refer to a
        specific living culture. Though, it’s debatable whether these
        associations with gecekondu neighborhoods are still accurate due to
        the dynamic social setting in Istanbul.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> My
        personal
        association with these structures, while keeping in mind my privileged
        point of view, was always the concept of flexibility. Flexibility in
        movement, space, and choices. Children playing on the streets without
        any limitations always looked very tempting. This was the first
        realization of how the creation of space could affect the way we use
        our bodies to move and our social interactions with other human
        beings. A perfectly cleanlooking house came with rigidity and a
        selfbuilt structure with a “build it yourself” mentality came with
        fluidity. Nonetheless, this would be romanticizing the gecekondu, it’s
        crucial to describe the infrastructural and social issues caused by
        informal structures first.

        Informal settlements caused by rapid urban growth bring many
        complications within cities on different levels. The World Bank’s
        urban population data helps to put the immensity in perspective since
        it states that as of 2020 half of the urban dwellers in the Global
        South reside in informal settlements.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> Considering
        that
        formations of slums and informal settlements often go hand in hand in
        this context, in the global report ‘The Challenge of Slums - Global
        Report on Human Settlements’ by UN-Habitat, slum areas are defined by
        the absence of qualities such as access to basic necessities, legal
        construction policies, social integration, and so on. The irregularity
        may cause disruption not only for its surroundings but its inhabitants
        as well. In a news article released by the World Health Organization,
        the struggles of the urban poor regarding the rapid spread of diseases
        and various health issues were reported. The lack of comprehensive
        sanitary facilities, access to basic needs, limited access to health
        care service, overcrowds, and industrial pollutants can be considered
        contributing factors.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> The health hazards within
        selfbuilt districts might be less obvious to the rest. But,
        considering the waste products lying on the streets of gecekondu
        neighbourhoods in Istanbul (Fig. 1), insufficient facilities in these
        areas may be more visible from the outside. In the report of
        UN-Habitat, the lack of services in these types of districts is also
        stated as insufficient waste management, electricity distribution,
        drainage systems, etc.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> Another first-hand
        consequence of
        informal housing is safety deficiency. Poverty being one of the main
        reasons, criminal rates are usually higher in slum areas in big
        cities. Poor infrastructure and planning of the areas make it more
        challenging for the police to address criminal activities and respond
        on time.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> The unsystematic structure of gecekondus
        causes
        similar malfunctions in cities which may put the urban poor in a
        vulnerable state. Therefore, gecekondus are almost always defined as a
        “problem”. Although, in gecekondus case, it’s not the lack of urban
        planning that is referred to as an issue, it’s the sociocultural
        intervention they cause within cities. In this paper, while
        recognizing the distress informal settlements can cause both for the
        city structure and its inhabitants, specifically the creative
        characteristics of gecekondus and the appearance of gecekondus in the
        art and design scene will be explored.

        In a global sense, there are different variations of informal
        settlements similar to gecekondus. As in Türkiye’s case, the
        socio-economic structures of countries manifest themselves through
        urban landscapes. With this in mind, informal settlements can be
        considered to be universal, since these areas originate for similar
        reasons.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-7" href="#fn-7">7</a></sup> As contemporary art can be used to shed
        light on
        social and cultural dynamics, irregular settlements around the world
        make an appearance in art and design disciplines. Even though the
        representation of social issues in artistic work is a sensitive
        matter, since the aestheticization of topics such as poverty can cause
        demeaning of certain groups, it can help urban planners and the state
        to have a broader understanding of social constructions. Favelissues<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8"
            href="#fn-8">8</a></sup>is a collaborative blog that researches Favelas in Brazil
        and produces information about informal urbanization. Created by
        Adriana Navarro Sertich is a good example of how such research can
        make the history of informal settlements accessible to the public
        while raising awareness about the urban realities. <sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-9"
            href="#fn-9">9</a></sup> Returning to gecekondu, “Ada”, translates as ‘Island’, by
        Oda Projesi showcased the construction process of a gecekondu house
        during the 8th International Istanbul Biennial together with Mustafa
        Tetik, a gecekondu master-builder, and his colleagues. Part of the
        project consisted of advertisement banners with “Gecekondu for rent”
        written on them placed on the street (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-10"
            href="#fn-10">10</a></sup> Distancing gecekondu from its social context, this
        performative piece may have not communicated to the audience as
        intended,<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-11" href="#fn-11">11</a></sup> however, it still revealed a
        significant part
        of gecekondus reality.

        Gecekondus organically shaped as there was an urgent need for a
        housing solution and became rather political. To understand the
        background of gecekondu, it’s necessary to understand the political
        evolution of Türkiye. When the Republic of Türkiye was founded in
        1923, Western financial models were adopted to reach the idea of a
        “civil” nation and maintain the modernization of the new-born country.
        The Eastern and South-eastern parts of Anatolia (Fig. 4) were always
        underdeveloped compared to the Western parts of Türkiye. This was
        partly because of challenging geographical conditions and political
        matters such as terrorism, and neglection of the government. The main
        source of income was agriculture and farming in these parts of the
        country, The Green Revolution (Third Agricultural Revolution) fuelled
        rapid urbanization that was happening.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-12" href="#fn-12">12</a></sup> The
        structural
        change in agriculture outcasted the need for labour force in
        agriculture, leaving people no other choice than to look for
        alternative ways to make a living. Less job opportunities left,
        poverty the absence of cultural institutions, educational
        establishments, and life-threatening situations like terrorism, were
        more than enough reasons to migrate to bigger cities like Istanbul,
        Ankara, Izmir, or Bursa.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-13" href="#fn-13">13</a></sup> In a sense, for the
        sake of
        modernization, many people were compelled to leave their villages.

        Istanbul was romanticized as a solution to people’s problems. The
        saying “Istanbul’s soil is gold” soon became the motive for people to
        leave their villages in hopes of starting a new life. To put the
        greatness of internal migration in perspective, between the years 1927
        and 1965 the population in big cities increased approximately 400
        percent.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-14" href="#fn-14">14</a></sup> To have a better understanding of the
        current
        state of the population of Istanbul, according to the Turkish
        Statistical Institute (TÜİK), Istanbul’s official population hit 15
        million 907 thousand 951 in 2022.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-15" href="#fn-15">15</a></sup> (To give a
        clearer
        idea one must look back to numbers from the 1960s when Istanbul’s
        population was approximately 2 million.)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-16" href="#fn-16">16</a></sup> It’s
        important
        to keep in mind that the numbers provided only represent registered
        citizens, but in reality, there are over 16 million residents in
        Istanbul today.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-17" href="#fn-17">17</a></sup> The process of
        “Gecekonduzation” of the
        city was the result of the earlier mentioned uncontrolled mass
        migration from the East to the West. Rural migrants who came to the
        city started building their own homes overnight, and so the story of
        gecekondu began. In (Fig. 5) the current expansion route of Istanbul
        can be seen. Kuipers and Broekema divided the urban formation as East
        to West and South to North. The Northern expansion alongside the
        Bosporus represents a higher quality of architecture whereas the
        extension from East to West embodies mostly informal settlements and a
        larger quantity of dwellings.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-18" href="#fn-18">18</a></sup> The way in which
        formations are explained in this article makes it easier to understand
        the characteristics of Istanbul’s districts as well as providing a
        simple visual representation of the socio-economic separation within
        the city.

        Towards the end of the 20th Century, significant parts of Türkiye’s
        population were already settled in urban areas. Almost half of
        Istanbul’s landscape consisted of gecekondu settlements already after
        a very short amount of time. Still relevant to current demographic
        dynamics in Türkiye, migration is viewed as the key phenomenon in the
        context of gecekondu. Even though population movement is considered
        the most significant reason for unplanned urbanization, it may be the
        result rather than the reason. Yeğin says, “Almost every city, first
        sketched on paper and then constructed, shortly finds itself deviating
        from the initial plans, succumbing to unplanned development, and
        ultimately facing the destiny shared by all cities. The incident here,
        constantly recurring, is not unplanned urban development; rather, it
        is the inability of the plan to constrain the city. (Önce kağıt
        üzerinde çizilen sonra inşa edilen neredeyse her kent, çok kısa bir
        zaman sonra, öncelikle doğrudan planların dışına, plansızlığa ve
        ardından da bütün kentlerin kaderine mahkum olur. Burada sorun,
        sürekli tekrarlanan şey, kentin plansız gelişmesi değil, tam tersine
        planın kenti sınırlayamaz olmasıdır.)”.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-19" href="#fn-19">19</a></sup>
        Uncontrollable
        numbers migrating to the city do indeed contribute to informal
        urbanization. However, the fundamental factor here is the reluctance
        to include outsiders in cities. The socio-cultural background and
        socio-economic consequences of mass migration were not taken into
        consideration in Türkiye’s case. Therefore, migrants invented their
        own ways to exist in the city, not only spatially but culturally too.
        The idea that people should fit into space created a distinct social
        separation within Istanbul, although space should form according to
        people’s needs.

        Given the circumstances in which gecekondu emerged, it can be
        challenging to define them. They are often compared to squatter
        settlements even though they are not exactly the same. In order to
        mention squatting we need to be speaking about an architectural
        formation that already exists. However, in the case of gecekondu
        settlements, the structure is constructed by the settlers themselves,
        on empty land whether it has an owner or not. We can only speak of a
        similarity between squatting and gecekondu if the land on which
        gecekondu is built is an owned property. In that case, the space would
        be occupied by another individual other than the land-holder, which is
        a similar action to squatting.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-20" href="#fn-20">20</a></sup>

        The perception of the gecekondu changed over time parallel to the
        political dynamics of Türkiye. Although the positioning of gecekondu
        showed slight changes throughout time, gecekondu residents were
        always considered as “others” in the city. Erman articulates four
        variations of “others” which shaped corresponding to the
        socio-political scene in Türkiye: “ ‘the rural Other’, ‘the
        disadvantaged Other’, ‘the urban poor Other(s)’, ‘the undeserving
        rich Other(s)’, ‘the culturally inferior Other(s) as Subculture’ and,
        ‘the threatening/varoşlu Other’”.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-21" href="#fn-21">21</a></sup> Cities, by
        cities it’s
        referred to the urban living culture, always exclude the ‘others’. As
        vague as these divisions may sound without an extensive explanation,
        the classifications of “others” simply indicate that the perception of
        gecekondu shifted from being seen as an obstacle to modernization to
        being considered a threat in the city. Gecekondu inhabitants have been
        outcasted for being in an in-between state of two opposite living
        styles, urban life and rural life. Gecekondu dwellers were always
        expected to assimilate, keep pace with the city, and live up to the
        urban ‘standards’. With the emergence of informal settlements, there
        were sociological surveys made to understand how “modern” gecekondu
        residents are constituted. The level of education, the way they dress,
        whether women put on make-up or not, and whether they contributed to
        cultural activities such as concerts, theatre plays, and movies were
        measured.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-22" href="#fn-22">22</a></sup> Although the true intentions behind
        the
        gecekondu surveys remain unclear, it’s debatable if they were
        extensive enough to capture the wide range of experiences and
        backgrounds within the gecekondu communities.

        Media channels played an important role in shifting the perception of
        the gecekondu, especially newspapers, among the rest of Türkiye’s
        population. Jean-François Pérouse, a social geographer, started
        creating an archive consisting of news regarding gecekondu over thirty
        years ago. In his interview with Yaşar Adnan Adanalı, in Gecekondu
        Talks, he says he aimed to “establish a somewhat
        alternative/independent memory for an oppressed ‘object’ that was
        created in a top-down manner, moving away from everyday life and
        navigating through the context of neighbourhoods.” According to
        Pérouse, he observed a drastic change in the stigmatization of
        gecekondu after the 90s, and this shift in recognition could be
        observed in the social structure. Although the notion of poverty was
        always emphasized in the news, the illegality element of gecekondu was
        more present after the 90’s according to Perouse.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-23"
            href="#fn-23">23</a></sup> Part
        of this evolution can be seen in Hürriyet’s headlines. In the issue
        of June 4th, 1948, the headline read “More and more Istanbul looks
        like an Anatolian village”. In 1976, the May 2nd issue of Hürriyet was
        dedicated exclusively to the gecekondu problem.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-24" href="#fn-24">24</a></sup>
        From one
        headline to a whole newspaper issue, the problem of gecekondu not
        only grew in square meters but also on paper. The concerns of
        Istanbulites regarding the legal angle were taking place in the news
        more frequently than before.

        Legitimization of gecekondu was strongly linked to the political
        interests of the government. Migrants chose election periods to build
        their gecekondus since the government would not interfere with the
        construction of gecekondu.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-25" href="#fn-25">25</a></sup> The government and
        gecekondu
        settlers themselves understood the significance of their influence
        regarding the results of the elections.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-26" href="#fn-26">26</a></sup> The
        silent
        agreement made between the state and gecekondu residents enabled the
        state to use gecekondus as a tool for its own benefit, while rural
        dwellers planning to move to the city were able to build their homes
        without disturbance. To get a clearer idea about the legal conflicts
        surrounding the topic of gecekondu Tuba Çetin shared her perspective
        for this research. As she said, legal regulations allowed gecekondu
        residents who were already settled to claim the plot after a certain
        amount of years. This resulted in the occupation of valuable
        territories in Istanbul by gecekondus and led to controversy among
        citizens. Even the area along the Bosporus, which was a
        non-developable zone and Istanbul’s most prized lands, began to be
        populated with gecekondus. Registration of gecekondus with title deeds
        within high-value lands of Istanbul resulted in the labelling of
        gecekondu residents as the “undeserving others” as Erman states.
        According to Çetin, it is favorable for Istanbul's lands to be opened
        for zoning. Since the state usually does not implement necessary
        regulations for lands that are off-limits for zoning, they tend to be
        more susceptible to informal settlements. The absence of financial
        security within the country compelled all parties to pursue any
        opportunities regarding the real estate sector. Consequently,
        gecekondu owners also became more aware of the value of their
        properties.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-27" href="#fn-27">27</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another interview in Gecekondu Talks with Velaaddin Kılıç reveals the
        background of gecekondus. While we encounter a strong tone of
        criticism towards gecekondus in the archived newspapers, Kılıç is
        commenting on the photography archive from the German Archaeological
        Institute with a touch of nostalgia. The archive consists of pictures
        taken by urban researchers from Germany who came to Istanbul in the
        final years of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s. (Fig. 6 and
        Fig. 7) The images do indicate the associations regarding gecekondu
        were different then. Gecekondus were truly a solution in which rural
        migrants created their space fitting for their way of living. In some
        of these images, there is no electricity, no sufficient public
        transportation let alone pavements, yet the man cleaning the street
        in Fig. 8 indicates a space looked after. Kılıç says
        “Gecekonduization, as a product of a different historical period, had
        provided a solution to the needs of people setting out with the hope
        for education, health, work, and sustenance. If you ask, 'In today's
        world, whose needs are being met by new-kondus?' could you please take
        another look at the photo, this time more carefully? Which one is more
        pleasing to the eye?” (Gecekondulaşma, farklı bir tarihsel dönemin bir
        ürünü olarak eğitim, sağlık, iş ve aş umuduyla yola düşen insanların
        ihtiyaçlarına çözüm olmuştu. “Yeni kondular günümüzde kimin hangi
        ihtiyacını karşılıyor?” derseniz, fotoğrafa bir kez daha ve dikkatlice
        bakar mısınız? Hangisi daha estetik ?)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-28" href="#fn-28">28</a></sup> The
        landscape
        reminds us of a village indeed, but it’s arguable if glass
        residential skyscrapers are more ‘civilized’ than the structures in
        the pictures. In fact, flats with identical floorplans seem to be less
        fitting to human nature.

        Moving away from how gecekondus are perceived in society, it’s
        important to zoom into gecekondus themselves to comprehend the social
        framework of gecekondu districts. Ayşegül Cankat, a Turkish architect
        uses gecekondu houses as architectural propositions and talks about
        the spatial formation of gecekondus. As she observed during her visits
        to gecekondu neighbourhoods, the correlation between social
        interactions and space is one of the identifying traits of gecekondus.
        The collective aspect of gecekondu areas was first shaped as a result
        of the migration of family relatives from rural areas. Later on, the
        gathering of gecekondu residents under the same umbrella as a
        multitude of “others” led to ambiguity regarding the social diversity
        within gecekondu districts. The lack of clarity on socio-cultural
        divisions contributed to gecekondu inhabitants being seen as one
        group.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-29" href="#fn-29">29</a></sup> The phrase “hemşerilik”, often used to
        describe
        the communal bonds among gecekondu neighbours, illustrates an
        expression of the social construction through language. One of the
        differentiating characteristics of gecekondu is the expansive use of
        the exterior areas (Fig. 9). The overflow of the interior to the
        exterior in gecekondu districts, which can be considered as a
        continuation of the rural lifestyle, supports the social interactions
        of the neighbours.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-30" href="#fn-30">30</a></sup>
        The absence of privacy in the gardens of gecekondus doesn’t allow
        inhabitants to be very individual either, which allows us to speak of
        a communal social structure.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Figure 10: “Chart of different types of settlements that form Istanbul.”</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The notion of oneness in the context of gecekondu can also be observed
        architecturally. As the mapping of different urban formations shows in
        Fig.10, navigating through gecekondu neighbourhoods is different than
        formal settlements. Informal settlement areas exemplified on the maps
        are curvilinear, reminding us of natural forms. It seems to be much
        more suitable for social relations as gardens of the houses act as
        spaces for human interaction. Built to serve social engagement,
        gecekondus are in contrast to cities, where people usually try to
        avoid each other. Another distinctive feature of gecekondu is the
        incompleteness of the architecture. The top floors of the houses are
        usually kept unbuilt in case a family member comes to settle (Fig.
        11). The idea of expansion resurfaces here, to provide additional
        space for newcomers and is another instance of space facilitating
        social needs. While in residential apartments, where space is
        pre-built, the flexibility to shape according to social occurrences
        stays in question. Living in pre-established spaces fails to give
        individuals the authority for the way they interact with the world
        through their movement. Returning to the initial paragraph, this
        statement is what sparked my interest, and may be the core difference
        between formal and informal lifestyles.

        Today it’s harder to find original gecekondus after land amnesties
        allowed the legalization of the typology of the gecekondus, which
        encouraged gecekondu owners to build multi-story apartments instead
        of single-story houses.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-31" href="#fn-31">31</a></sup> Later on, the unclear
        land
        ownership situation in gecekondu districts became a tool for the
        private and state actors to carry their neo-liberal policies under the
        name of Urban Renewal. After the Marmara earthquake, many gecekondu
        areas were claimed by the state, declaring them disaster risk areas.
        This led to the eviction of gecekondu dwellers and many mega-housing
        projects arose among the cityscapes.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-32" href="#fn-32">32</a></sup>
        Zeytinburnu being
        one of the first gecekondu neighbourhoods, and still being referred to
        as a gecekondu area, has almost no gecekondus anymore. Therefore, I
        couldn’t continue to explore the subject of gecekondu in the
        Zeytinburnu area. Instead, the Gülsuyu neighbourhood was chosen to go
        in person for this paper, where the original gecekondus can still be
        seen.

        To begin describing my walk through Gülsuyu, it’s important to start
        with the map. Even though gecekondus make up an important part of
        Istanbul, it’s not officially declared which neighbourhoods are
        gecekondu districts. For instance, municipalities’ websites usually
        show the neighbourhoods within a district, and maybe mention the
        history of gecekondus built there previously. However, it’s not
        possible to find official information about which streets still
        contain original gecekondus. Everyone sees, talks, and hears about
        gecekondu, but it’s not easy to be specific about their place on the
        map. It’s possible to learn about the locations of gecekondus based on<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-33"
            href="#fn-33">33</a></sup> Now, gecekondus can be compared to a legend passed down
        from mouth to mouth. In Fig.12 a screenshot from Google Maps is shown,
        demonstrating the Maltepe district in Istanbul. The area left within
        the red border is the Gülsuyu neighbourhood and towards the top left
        corner, the Zümrütevler neighbourhood can be seen. When you look
        closer to the streets, it’s easy to locate the gecekondus and other
        forms of settlements. Gülsuyu’s streets from a bird’s-eye view look
        much more chaotic than Zümrütevler for instance. The difference
        between urban formations can be observed on the map. To locate
        gecekondus on the map one must look at the organic formation of the
        streets, as in this comparison Zümrütevler generally consists of
        multi-story mid-class apartment settlements while Gülsuyu mostly
        contains gecekondus.

        If you’re from Türkiye, ‘varoş’ is the word that would come to mind
        when speaking of gecekondus. Varoş is where the poor, the uneducated,
        and the so-called uncivilized live. The term was invented at the
        beginning of the 90’s and turned the gecekondu into an enemy in
        cities. In a literal sense, the word is used to refer to
        neighbourhoods far away from the city centre. But in today’s context,
        it is used to refer to districts with lower socio-economic classes
        within urban settings. Drifting away from its actual meaning, varoş
        does not mean someplace far geographically, rather it’s somewhere
        culturally distant. The assigned meaning to the term created negative
        associations in the Turkish social scene.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-34" href="#fn-34">34</a></sup>
        Unlike what
        gecekondus were when they first made an appearance in the urban
        landscape, they became something to avoid and dangerous to encounter.
        Gülsuyu is one of the varoş neighbourhoods where mostly Kurdish and
        Alevi people currently live. Besides the stigmatization of gecekondu
        present in the Turkish society, it’s clear that feeling safe is
        challenging in gecekondu regions. Gülsuyu is one of the neighbourhoods
        which is considered rather safe compared to some other areas in
        Istanbul.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-35" href="#fn-35">35</a></sup> The pictures you see were taken
        during a walk
        through this area in December 2023. While talking to Çetin (mentioned
        in the first chapter) during our walk, a lot of legal terms arose.
        Rentier (excessive profit gain)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-35" href="#fn-35">35</a></sup>, hypothec (“an
        obligation, right, or security given by contract or by operation of
        law to a creditor over property of the debtor without transfer of
        possession or title to the creditor”)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-37" href="#fn-37">37</a></sup>, land
        (“an area of
        ground, especially when used for a particular purpose such as farming
        or building”)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-38" href="#fn-38">38</a></sup>, property (“buildings and land,
        considered
        as things to be bought and sold”)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-39" href="#fn-39">39</a></sup>, title deed
        (“a
        document that states and proves a person's legal right to own a piece
        of land or a building”)<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-40" href="#fn-40">40</a></sup> were some of them. Many
        Turkish
        citizens have a strong grasp of the meaning of these terms since urban
        transformation projects led to a housing market boom in the finance
        scene.

        While the legal terms aim to organize the ownership over land,
        territory, a plot and the construction of property, the materiality of
        gecekondus forms another layer that grabs attention. Certain
        architectural elements are taken out of their context and repurposed.
        For instance, many doors are used to divide the space between the
        streets and the gardens/patios of the houses. In the sense of creating
        a barrier between the exterior and the interior, as a door usually
        does, they are still used in a similar way. Some doors were displaced
        and put in a way which could not be used anymore (Fig. 13). Coming
        across fixtures losing their functionality from place to place is one
        of the results of spontaneity. Many metal panels in different shapes
        and forms were used to divide spaces and create fencing (Fig. 14). It
        can be imagined that natural materials used in village houses, such as
        wood, stone, mud, reed, etc. were replaced by industrial materials in
        the city. Steel, plastic, aluminum, and PVC frequently appear in the
        Gülsuyu district due to the exchange of building components. Opposing
        to minimalistic residences in cities, gecekondus are overflowing with
        details. Materials gathered have many different patterns, creating a
        clashing environment. Concrete being the main construction element, is
        another material that can be seen often. Bare cement revealed on the
        streets composes a raw atmosphere (Fig. 15). The tangibility of
        Gülsuyu houses brings a sense of sincerity, where architecture is not
        necessarily attractive but is configured according to human action.
        Although, some gecekondus have very bright colors (Fig. 16): blue,
        yellow, fuchsia, pink, green even bright orange. Compared to an accent
        wall in a living room, it’s used as a way to add character to
        gecekondus. Personalized bright-colored gecekondus create “accent”
        residences among the city landscape.

        Materials used in gecekondus are important components of
        solution-making in the context of sheltering emergencies and are used
        in architectural models. Cankat, who was mentioned in the previous
        paragraphs, analyses gecekondus to create more sustainable
        architectural propositions (Fig. 17).<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-41" href="#fn-41">41</a></sup> She is a
        firm
        believer in the redrawing of gecekondus and incorporating knowledge
        generated in the literature of architecture. Internationally speaking,
        Teddy Cruz might be a better-known architect who also studies
        space-making methods used to construct informal settlements in Tijuana
        as a starting point for his own designs (Fig. 18). In his Ted Talk,
        Cruz states that surely there is a lot to observe among slum areas in
        Tijuana in terms of socioeconomic sustainability. He has been
        investigating the circulation of materials to Tijuana from San
        Francisco, and the transformation of these materials into building
        agents. According to Cruz, bungalows that are no longer used, tires,
        and garage doors are a few examples of materials that can be supplied
        to citizens of Tijuana and could help ease the housing emergency.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-42"
            href="#fn-42">42</a></sup> Analysis of informal housing could provide tools for
        architects and urban designers to be better prepared for future
        shelter crises. Coming back to Türkiye’s case, gecekondu could offer
        valuable insight into how space can be utilized for a more inclusive
        urban environment.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-43" href="#fn-43">43</a></sup>
        Understanding the architectural formation of informal settlements can
        lead to a stronger grasp of the social ecosystem within gecekondu
        neighborhoods and find harmony between the formal and the informal.

        The story of Gecekondus started 80 years ago as an answer to the
        search by villagers for a better life. They were renamed, re-shaped,
        and re-constructed throughout history. Gecekondus became the symbol of
        the poor, disdained, and the vulnerable. They have been the home to
        ‘others’ in the endless urban. These plain pieces of land turned into
        prizes to fight over, and so gecekondus were used, appropriated, and
        even taken advantage of. From village houses in the city to apartment
        blocks to glass residences, gecekondus became a part of a true
        transformation(!). On one hand, the legal conflicts brought by
        informality, on the other hand, the struggle of the urban poor with
        social injustice bring the story of the gecekondus to a multifaceted
        point. Today’s gecekondus are becoming playthings between the state
        and big corporations, and once again show the complex connection
        between urban growth and the social, economic, and political
        structures of society.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-44" href="#fn-44">44</a></sup> The housing market in
        Istanbul,
        where the soil is considered gold, became an instrument of rapid
        profit making rather than something serving the need for shelter
        leaving the urban poor defenseless. Can attaining insight into the
        gecekondu way of living, which has always been looked down upon until
        now, turn the scale around and ensure a more sustainable urban life on
        both social and financial levels?
